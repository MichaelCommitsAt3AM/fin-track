CRITICAL STEP: You must add the "Inter" fonts here.

Go to Google Fonts: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter

Download the family.

Find these font files from the download:

Inter-Regular.ttf

Inter-Medium.ttf

Inter-SemiBold.ttf

Inter-Bold.ttf

Rename them in all lowercase:

inter_regular.ttf

inter_medium.ttf

inter_semibold.ttf

inter_bold.ttf

Drag and drop these 4 renamed files into this res/font directory in Android Studio.
